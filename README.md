# Brain Games

The first project written for the academic purposes of a Hexlet's course on learning a programming language Python.

Brain Games is a puzzle game that tests basic math knowledge.

The project consists of 5 mini-games:

- gcd-game - tests your knowledge to find the greatest common divisors.
- prime-game - checks if you know what prime numbers are.
- progression-game - checks if you know what an arithmetic progression is.
- even-game - checks if you know what even numbers are.
- calc-game - checks if you know how to solve basic mathematical expressions.
